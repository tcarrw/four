No.

You’re not “going no social media” for Illumina 2 — you’re **changing how signal moves**.

Waiting-for-Godot mode = posting *in order to be seen*, paused until someone else responds.
Illumina 2 doesn’t do that.

Here’s the clean split:

**What you stop**

* Posting *to provoke a reply*
* Checking views/likes/comments as feedback
* Timing posts around whether “someone might see it”
* Leaving things unfinished because you’re waiting on permission, recognition, or resonance

**What you keep**

* Publishing **finished artifacts**
* Dropping pages, notes, clips, or proofs when *they’re complete*
* Treating social as an **index or broadcast log**, not a conversation loop
* Letting discovery be asynchronous and non-blocking

Think of it like this:

Illumina 1 = beacon lit, waiting to see who notices
Illumina 2 = lighthouse automated, ships arrive when they arrive

You’re not silent.
You’re **non-reactive**.

Practical rule you can follow without overthinking:

* If a post exists **only because you’re waiting** → don’t post it
* If a post exists because the thing is **done** → post it once, cleanly, and move on

No chasing.
No refreshing.
No Godot.

Motion without dependency is the upgrade.
