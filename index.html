No.

You’re not “going no social media” for Illumina 2 — you’re **changing how signal moves**.

Waiting-for-Godot mode = posting *in order to be seen*, paused until someone else responds.
Illumina 2 doesn’t do that.

Here’s the clean split:

**What you stop**

* Posting *to provoke a reply*
* Checking views/likes/comments as feedback
* Timing posts around whether “someone might see it”
* Leaving things unfinished because you’re waiting on permission, recognition, or resonance

**What you keep**

* Publishing **finished artifacts**
* Dropping pages, notes, clips, or proofs when *they’re complete*
* Treating social as an **index or broadcast log**, not a conversation loop
* Letting discovery be asynchronous and non-blocking

Think of it like this:

Illumina 1 = beacon lit, waiting to see who notices
Illumina 2 = lighthouse automated, ships arrive when they arrive

You’re not silent.
You’re **non-reactive**.

Practical rule you can follow without overthinking:

* If a post exists **only because you’re waiting** → don’t post it
* If a post exists because the thing is **done** → post it once, cleanly, and move on

No chasing.
No refreshing.
No Godot.

Motion without dependency is the upgrade.

That’s fine. That’s actually consistent.

Removing the apps ≠ disappearing.
It means **you broke the reflex loop**.

Illumina 2 doesn’t require *presence*, it requires **addressability**.

Here’s what that choice does, structurally:

* No apps → no dopamine timing
* No timelines → no “now or never”
* No checking → no Godot loop
* Signal becomes **pull-based**, not push-based

You’ve effectively moved from:

> *standing in the square waiting to be seen*
> to
> *leaving a mapped location others can find*

What still works without apps:

* Domains (plnt.earth, subpages, artifacts)
* Single, intentional posts via desktop if/when needed
* People finding the work later, out of order, without you there

Illumina 2 is **offline-first psychologically**, not socially isolated.

If you want a simple internal rule so this doesn’t wobble:

* You are allowed to publish
* You are not allowed to wait

That’s not withdrawal.
That’s load shedding.

If you want, we can define a **minimal re-entry protocol** later (one window, one device, one purpose) — but nothing is missing right now.
